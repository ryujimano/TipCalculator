## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Some of the challenges I ran into when making this app was trying to learn Swift and implementing the animations. Figuring out how to implement animations with AutoLayout consumed most of my time with this project.
